#AMP Playlist plugin

Playlists for Azure Media Player.
Based on videojs plugin https://github.com/jgallen23/videojs-playLists 


##Demo

A [demo](http://oriziv.github.io/amp-playlist) is now available to showcase what you can create with this plugin.

##Installation

TBD

##Usage

Just create a list of playlist items/videos , and call `player.playlist(items);` to set the playlist and start playing.
Each item needs to include at least source. If 2 items has the same source the player will know
to just jump to next point without setting the same source again.

### Initialize playlist

In order to initialize `playlist` you need to pass an array of items with this structure:

```js
var items = [
  {
    
    // Playlist item source object, can contain 1:n source types of the supported video file types
    src : [
      '//example/path/to/myVideo.ism/manifest',
      '//example/path/to/myVideo.webm',
      '//example/path/to/myVideo.mp4',
      '//example/path/to/myVideo.ogv'
    ],
    poster : '',
    title : 'Video 1',
    
    // Optional token
    token:"Bearer=......eV7HDgZ9msp9H9bnEPGN91sBdU7XsZ9OyB6VgFhKBAU%3d.....",
    
    // Optional tokenType
    tokenType:"AES",
    
    // Optional timeRange 
    // If set then player will know to jump to relevant point due to this object.
    timeRange:{
      start:0, //sec
      end:30
    }
     
},
  {
    src : [
      '//example/path/to/myVideo.ism/manifest',
    ],
    poster : 'http://www.videojs.com/img/poster.jpg',
    title : 'Video 2'
  }
];

// Create AMP Instance
var player = amp("azuremediaplayer", {});

// Init playlist
player.playlist(items);

```

Now, when videos plays they automatically jump to the next one. You also gain a couple of methods

### Jump to video

Use `player.playlist(index)` to jump to a video into the playlist.

### next

AMP receives a `next()` function which put in place the next video.

### prev

AMP receives a `prev()` function which put in place the previous video.

### stop

AMP recieves a `stop()` function which stops the playlist, and resets it (set the player to the first item in playlist)

### Events

<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>next</td><td>Fired when you use the `next()` function or when one video finish and the next starts.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>prev</td><td>Fired when you use the `prev()` function.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>stop</td><td>Fired when you use the `stop()` function.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>lastVideoEnded</td><td>Fired when the playlist has finished.</td></tr>
</table>
